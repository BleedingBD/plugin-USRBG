# USRBG

This plugin will allow you to see [USRBG](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg) banners in your Discord client. These banners will only be visible to users of the plugin or other implementations of USRBG banners.

To get a USRBG banner follow the instructions on the [USRBG GitHub page](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg#request-your-own-usrbg).

What this plugin **will not** do is stop giving you free access to actual Nitro banners. If you want Nitro banners, pay for Nitro.
